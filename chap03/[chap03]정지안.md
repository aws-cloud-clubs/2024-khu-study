# Strategies for System Design Interviews

System Design Interviews ⇒ 

Demonstrating design skills and the ability to defend decisions made during the process

1. Understanding the problem and defining the scope of the design
    
    It is risky to provide answers without fully understanding the requirements
    
    → red flag
    
    Gather necessary information for system construction through questioning or making assumptions (**Write down assumptions for later reference)**
    
2. Presenting a rough design proposal and seeking agreement
    
    Present the initial blueprint of the design to the interviewer and seek feedback
    
    Calculate rigorously whether the initial design meets the constraints related to the system's scale
    
3. Detailed design
    
    Identify the key areas of focus and prioritize the components based on their importance and interdependencies
    
4. Conclusion
    
    Never say that there’s no room for improvement
    
    It's also beneficial to summarize the design and explain potential issues that may arise if errors occur
